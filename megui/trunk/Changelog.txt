2894 [Main]                 moved menu items:
                            - "options\update" to "tools\update"
                            - "options\settings" to "options"
                            - "workers\settings" to "options"
                            - "workers\overview" to "view\worker overview"
2893 [OneClick]             fixed fatal error in some cases (regression of 2882). bug #937
2892 [AVS Script Creator]   added an option in the profile to use the DGIndexNV crop & resize filter if possible
                            if resize with DGIndexNV is enabled also cropping will be done that way (mod4 is forced for crop values)
                            fixed always applying the resize parameters to DGSource() (regression of 2891)
2891 [DGIndexNV Indexer]    fixed invalid input filter syntax (regression of 2890)
2890 [Settings]             added option to restrict input filters to 8 bit (enabled by default)
     [x264]                 fixed high bit depth support if ffmpeg is not used (regression of 2874)
2889 [Queue]                multiple "waiting" jobs can be assigned to a temporary worker to be processed
                            internal queue handling optimizations
2888 [Main]                 changed File\Exit shortcut from CTRL+X to ALT+F4
2887 [Worker]               improved the priority system so that for each job type the process and I/O priority can be defined
                            changing the priority in the progress window does change it only for the current job
                            moved some settings from options\settings to worker\settings (these will reset to default)
     [OneClick]             improved priority change and job abort actions
     [L-SMASH Indexer]      improved priority change and job abort actions
2886 [Jobs]                 fixed abort of suspended jobs (regression of 2818)
2885 [Preset Exporter]      fixed overwrite of output files
2884 [Worker]               changed worker handling
                            - in "workers\settings" worker rule sets can be specified
                              based on those rules it is determined how many jobs of which type are allowed to run in parallel
                              also on that page the maximum number of workers can be set (default: 2)
                            - temporary workers ignore all restrictions
                            - removed several obsolete worker windows and options
2883 [IFOParser]            improved subtitle detection. bug #925
2882 [OneClick]             fixed only using at maximum 2 audio/subtible tracks in batch mode (regression of 2861). bug #927
2881 [HD Streams Extractor] force "-keepDialnorm" if required for a E-AC3 tracks
2880 [AVS Script Creator]   fixed initial MediaInfo warning (regression of 2877)
2879 [Queue]                improved power save mode supression (requires at least Windows 7)
2878 [MediaInfo]            improved track detection of Blu-ray playlists
2877 [OneClick]             added support for VFR input files (requires mkv/mp4 output)
     [FFMS Indexer]         added support for VFR input files
     [MKV Muxer]            added detection of timestamp files (must be in the format "videoinputfilename".timestamp.txt)
     [MP4 Muxer]            added mp4fpsmod tool to mux timecodes into mp4 files
     [x264]                 added support for --tc-in
                            


Changelog 2836 --> 2876


Features/Changes:
                       added high bit depth support (requires AVS+)
					   therefore avs4x26x has been replaced by ffmpeg when using x26x
[AviSynth]             changed default value of "always use the included AviSynth" to enabled
[Chapter Creator]      - added option to use an automated counter for chapters (enabled by default)
                       - added fps selector for the input source.it does change the time codes if the input fps is not known (e.g. as with TXT/XML)
                       - the output fps value is used during saving for all output types

Enhancements/Fixes:
[HD Streams Extractor] added an option to select if the output prefix should be added (default: enabled)
[OneClick]             fixed tracks 2 to n-1 not properly selecting their input track stream (regression of 2808). bug #907
[OneClick]             fixed audio track processing for some file types if DG* indexer is used (e.g. VOB without IFO)


Known Problems:
- Windows Vista and older are not supported
- Unicode is not supported
- M2TS bitrate calculator does not calculate correct values as the specifications are unknown
