Changelog 2876 --> 2896

Features/Changes:
[Worker]               improved worker handling
                       - for each job type the process and I/O priority can be defined
                       - changing the priority in the progress window does change it only for the current job
                       - rule sets can be specified based on which it is determined how many jobs of which type are allowed to run in parallel
                       - settings to be found in the options window	  
[Main]                 some menu items have been moved/renamed:
                       - "options\settings"       to "options"
                       - "options\update"         to "tools\update"
                       - "workers\worker summary" to "view\worker overview"
[Settings]             input filters are restricted to 8 bit by default (to be disabled in the options window)
[OneClick]             added support for VFR input files (requires mkv/mp4 output)
 

Enhancements/Fixes:
[OneClick]             fixed only using at maximum 2 audio/subtitle tracks in batch mode (regression of 2861). bug #927
[x264]                 fixed high bit depth support if ffmpeg is not used (regression of 2874)
[AVS Script Creator]   if resize with DGIndexNV is enabled also cropping will be done that way (mod4 is forced for crop values)


Changelog 2836 --> 2876

Features/Changes:
                       added high bit depth support (requires AVS+)
                       therefore avs4x26x has been replaced by ffmpeg when using x26x
[AviSynth]             changed default value of "always use the included AviSynth" to enabled
[Chapter Creator]      - added option to use an automated counter for chapters (enabled by default)
                       - added fps selector for the input source.it does change the time codes if the input fps is not known (e.g. as with TXT/XML)
                       - the output fps value is used during saving for all output types

Enhancements/Fixes:
[HD Streams Extractor] added an option to select if the output prefix should be added (default: enabled)
[OneClick]             fixed tracks 2 to n-1 not properly selecting their input track stream (regression of 2808). bug #907
[OneClick]             fixed audio track processing for some file types if DG* indexer is used (e.g. VOB without IFO)


Known Problems:
- Windows Vista and older are not supported
- Unicode is not supported
- M2TS bitrate calculator does not calculate correct values as the specifications are unknown
