                            - temporary workers ignore all restrictions

Changelog 2836 --> 2876


Features/Changes:
                       added high bit depth support (requires AVS+)
					   therefore avs4x26x has been replaced by ffmpeg when using x26x
[AviSynth]             changed default value of "always use the included AviSynth" to enabled
[Chapter Creator]      - added option to use an automated counter for chapters (enabled by default)
                       - added fps selector for the input source.it does change the time codes if the input fps is not known (e.g. as with TXT/XML)
                       - the output fps value is used during saving for all output types

Enhancements/Fixes:
[HD Streams Extractor] added an option to select if the output prefix should be added (default: enabled)
[OneClick]             fixed tracks 2 to n-1 not properly selecting their input track stream (regression of 2808). bug #907
[OneClick]             fixed audio track processing for some file types if DG* indexer is used (e.g. VOB without IFO)


Known Problems:
- Windows Vista and older are not supported
- Unicode is not supported
- M2TS bitrate calculator does not calculate correct values as the specifications are unknown
