2858 [Video Encoder]        removed input/output settings from the command line preview
2857 [x265]                 replaced avs4x26x with ffmpeg
2856 [x264]                 replaced avs4x26x with ffmpeg
2855 [Chapter Creator]      input fps can always be selected
                            time codes will only be changed when the input fps is changed if the input fps of the source is not known (regression of 2851)
                            the window can be minimized
     [AVS Cutter]           video preview can be closed
2854 [Source Detector]      added high bit depth support
                            new "Minimum Analysis Percent" mode when set to 0 (default 0).
                                only "Minimum Analysis Sections" has to be reached in sequential read therefore providing a quick detection method
2853 [Update]               if automatic updates are disabled and the update window is manually opened no question will be raised anymore if packages have to be downloaded
2852 [x264]                 changed "show advanced settings" to be a global setting (default is disabled)
                            when --no-psy is selected the --psy-rd options are not availble
                            when using 8bit --qpmax with a value > 69 is used as 69 for the command line creation
2851 [Chapter Creator]      added fps selector for the input source
                            changing the input fps changes the time codes if the input fps is not known (e.g. as with TXT/XML)
                            the output fps value is used during saving for all output types
                            new chapters are sorted based on time codes
                            double click on a chapter jumps to the positions if the preview pane is open
                            preview button asks for an AVS file
                            added option to use an automated counter for chapters (enabled by default)
                            if the "Start Time" value is in a wrong format the text color is changed to red
                            the Chapter Creator window stays on top of the video preview window 
2850 [HD Streams Extractor] added support for EAC3 in files
                            "Custom Options" setting will be saved
2849                        scripts with high bit depth are converted to 8 bit when processed internally (e.g. for VideoPlayer). part II
2848                        scripts with high bit depth are converted to 8 bit when processed internally (e.g. for VideoPlayer)
2847 [AviSynth Wrapper]     added high bit depth support
2846 [Audio Encoder]        only use TimeStretchPlugin() if AVS+ is not used
2845 [MP4 Muxer]            fixed missing MediaInfo of output file if the extension is m4v/m4a
                            fixed missing prompt if an existing m4v/m4a file should be overwritten
2844 [OneClick]             fixed cleanup job not to fail anymore if the input file does not exist (regression of 2825). bug #913
2843 [AVS / Audio Cutter]   fixed cut length off by one frame. bug #912
2842 [Main]                 improved logging if a profile/setting cannot be loaded. bug #910
2841 [OneClick]             fixed audio track processing for some file types if DG* indexer is used (e.g. VOB without IFO)
2840 [Main]                 fixed a crash if a folder is dropped onto the main window. bug #906
2839 [OneClick]             fixed tracks 2 to n-1 not properly selecting their input track stream (regression of 2808). bug #907
2838 [x264]                 do not add "--output-depth 8" for 8 bit targets. feature request #636
2837 [Updater]              redist files are only copied if not installed
                            added information which redist packages are installed to the log
